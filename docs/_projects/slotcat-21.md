SlotCat-21
----------

This is a far simpler design than any of the others and merely facilitates the use of Slot-2 processors on Slot-1 motherboards via a riser The Slot2 SC-330 interface actually introduces no new signals or alternate functionality to the Slot-1 connector, it merely adds additional power and ground pins to support the higher requirements of the Slot-2 Intel Xeon processors and their large caches. I have already managed to source appropriate connectors for this purpose.
